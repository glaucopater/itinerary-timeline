Workflow
===

Analyzing the prototype I decided to split each elements into different components. 
In the first hours I realized that was more useful to use a list of items, even for a semantic concepts.
To recreate the circle for the bullet points I used different pseuso selectors, playing with after and before.
For styling I first wrote it in CSS then in SASS adding some variables and mixin.
For the images I decided to use a standard glyph external library, FontAwesome 4. 
The target viewport is for small device but can be set wide devices thanks to responsive rules.

For mocking up data and test I used fakeprops module, which speed up a lot the testing development phase. 
It has been tested in different devices and browsers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
So the normal workflow for building and running is still valid:


### `npm install`

To install dependencies

### `npm start`

To run

### `npm test`

To run unit tests

### `npm test -- --coverage`

To check unit test coverage
