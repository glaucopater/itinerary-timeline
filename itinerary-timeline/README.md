Workflow
===

Analyzing the prototype I decided to split each elements into different components. 
For styling I first wrote it in CSS then in SASS adding some variables and mixin.
The target viewport is for small device but can be set wide devices thanks to responsive rules.

For mocking up data and test I used fakeprops module, which speed up a lot the testing development phase. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
So the normal workflow for building and running is still valid:


### `npm install`

To install dependencies

### `npm start`

To run

### `npm test`

To run unit tests

### `npm test -- --coverage`

To check unit test coverage
